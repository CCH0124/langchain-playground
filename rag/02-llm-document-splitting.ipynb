    "    - 根據「字元長度」進行分割\n",
    "    - 常見於基本 chunk 設定，例如每段 500 字元\n",
    "2. MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter()\n",
    "    - 根據 Markdown 中的標題層級（如 #, ##）進行分割\n",
    "    - 適合處理 .md 技術文件或章節結構化資料\n",
    "3. TokenTextSplitter()\n",
    "    - 依據 token 數量 分割\n",

    "    - 最推薦的預設選擇\n",
    "    - 會嘗試以不同分隔符（如段落、句號、空白）進行分割\n",
    "    - 無法分成功時再退回用更細分的方式（遞迴式 fallback）\n",

    "✅ 適用於通用文本、自動平衡語意結構與 chunk 長度\n",

    "6. Language()（⚠️ 較冷門）\n",
    "    - 適用於 code file 分割（例如 C++, Python, Ruby, Markdown）\n",

    "\n",
    "7. NLTKTextSplitter()\n",
